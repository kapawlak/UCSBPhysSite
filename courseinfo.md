<h2> A Multimeter</h2>
<p> In order to make electrical measurements, you will need to have a digital multimeter. Any multimeter will work. 
We suggest the 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0842HTN8C/?coliid=I171D8G05V6R0U&colid=130URV13JNMZS&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it'>AstroAI DM130B</a>
which is sold on Amazon for approximately $16, and has an auto-ranging feature. </p>

A cheaper version is the 
<a href ='https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=astroai+multimeter&qid=1607467241&s=industrial&sr=1-4'>
AstroAI AM33D
</a> which costs about $12. This version does not have auto-ranging, so you will have to turn the dial to the appropraite measurement scale.

<h2>Additional Supplies</h2>
<h3> Stong Magnets</h3>
<p> You will need some strong magnets, such as these 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GS9SLRD/?coliid=IR3D3WNVOB4WZ&colid=130URV13JNMZS&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it'>
neodynium magnets
</a>. Note that you can usually find these for $2-$3 at any hardware store.
</p>


<h3>Long Wire</h3>
<p> Any long (~10ft+), insulated wire will do. You should look for solid 22 or 24 gauge wire. The cheapest we found on amazon is this 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DYHHMYH/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_Tto3FbD4K7AJB'>
magnet wire
</a> and this 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DYHHMYH/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_-Ho3FbTACA38T'>insulated wire</a>. Either will do. Again, this material is usually available quite cheaply at any hardware or hobby store.
